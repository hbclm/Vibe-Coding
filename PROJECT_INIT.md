# VibeCoding Project Initialization Guide

> Instructions for AI when initializing a new project using VibeCoding template

## Overview

This template provides a comprehensive structure for starting new software projects with proper documentation, development guidelines, and team collaboration standards.

## Initialization Process

When a user requests to create a new project using VibeCoding template, follow these steps:

### Step 0: Project Idea Analysis (FIRST STEP - CRITICAL)

**Before asking any other questions**, gather the core project idea:

**Question 0**: **What is your project idea?**

Ask the user to describe:

- **Project concept**: What are you building? What problem does it solve?
- **Key features**: What are the main features you envision?
- **Target users**: Who will use this?
- **Why this project**: What's the motivation behind building this?

**AI Response Required**:

After receiving the user's project idea, you MUST:

1. **Analyze** the project concept thoroughly
2. **Suggest additional features** that would complement the core idea:

   - Essential features they might have missed
   - Nice-to-have features for better UX
   - Technical features (authentication, API, admin panel, etc.)
   - Scalability features (caching, CDN, etc.)

3. **Present suggestions** to the user in an organized format:

   ```
   Based on your project idea, here are suggested features:

   **Core Features** (Essential):
   - [Feature 1]
   - [Feature 2]

   **Enhanced Features** (Recommended):
   - [Feature 3]
   - [Feature 4]

   **Technical Features**:
   - [Feature 5]
   - [Feature 6]

   Which of these would you like to include?
   ```

4. **Wait for confirmation** before proceeding to Step 1

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed to Step 1 (Basic Information) until the user has reviewed and confirmed the feature list.

## Step 2: Generate Project Files

Once you have gathered the necessary information, proceed to:

### 2.1 Process Template Files

For each `.template.md` file in the project:

1. **Read the template file**
2. **Replace all placeholders** with actual values:

   - `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` → Actual project name
   - `{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}` → Project description
   - `{{TAGLINE}}` → Project tagline
   - `{{TECH_STACK_*}}` → Specific technology choices
   - `{{BACKEND_FRAMEWORK}}` → Chosen backend framework
   - `{{FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK}}` → Chosen frontend framework
   - `{{DATABASE}}` → Chosen database
   - `{{ARCHITECTURE_TYPE}}` → Architecture style
   - `{{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}` → Target users
   - `{{MARKET_FOCUS}}` → Market/region
   - `{{BUSINESS_MODEL}}` → Business model (if applicable)
   - And any other placeholders in the templates

3. **Save as new file** without `.template` extension:

   - `README.template.md` → `README.md`
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.template.md` → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - etc.

4. **Delete the `.template.md` files** after processing

### 2.2 Create Project Context File

Create `.ai/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` with the gathered information for future AI reference:

```markdown
# Project Context

**Project Name**: [name]
**Type**: [type]
**Tech Stack**: [stack summary]
**Target Audience**: [audience]

## Key Decisions

- Architecture: [choice and rationale]
- Database: [choice and rationale]
- API Design: [choice and rationale]

## Goals

1. [goal 1]
2. [goal 2]
   ...

## MVP Features

- [feature 1]
- [feature 2]
  ...
```

### 2.2b Generate Project TODO

Process `.ai/TODO.template.md` to create `.ai/TODO.md` with detailed task breakdown:

**Based on**:

- Project type and features (from Step 0)
- Tech stack choices
- MVP scope
- Timeline estimates

**Generate**:

- Phase breakdown (Foundation, Core Features, Polish, etc.)
- Specific tasks for each phase
- Documentation checklist
- Success milestones
- Estimated completion percentages

**Example structure**:

```markdown
## Phase 1: Foundation

- [ ] Setup [backend framework] project
- [ ] Configure [database]
- [ ] Setup [frontend framework]
      ...

## Phase 2: Core Features

- [ ] Implement [feature 1]
- [ ] Implement [feature 2]
      ...
```

Make tasks SPECIFIC to the project, not generic. Include framework-specific tasks (e.g., "Setup FastAPI with Poetry" not just "Setup backend").

### 2.3 Generate LICENSE File

Based on the user's license choice, create the appropriate `LICENSE` file:

- **MIT License**: Use standard MIT license text with current year and project name
- **Apache 2.0**: Use Apache 2.0 license text
- **GPL v3**: Use GPL v3 license text
- **BSD 3-Clause**: Use BSD 3-Clause license text
- **Proprietary**: Create custom license or "All Rights Reserved" notice
- **Other**: Use user-specified license text

Update copyright holder to `{{PROJECT_NAME}} Team` or as specified by user.

### 2.4 Update .gitignore

Add `.ai/` back to `.gitignore` to prevent committing AI context files:

```gitignore
# AI Context (add this line at the end)
.ai/
```

### 2.5 Create Directory Structure

Based on the chosen tech stack, create appropriate directory structure:

**For Backend Projects:**

```
src/
├── api/
├── models/
├── services/
├── utils/
└── config/
tests/
docs/
```

**For Full-stack Projects:**

```
backend/
├── src/
└── tests/
frontend/
├── src/
├── public/
└── tests/
docs/
```

Adjust according to framework conventions.

### 2.6 Generate Optional Documentation Files

Based on user's answers, generate these files:

#### CONTRIBUTING.md

**Generate if**: Project is open-source (Question 20 = "Yes" or "Partially")

- Process `docs/CONTRIBUTING.template.md`
- Fill placeholders for contribution guidelines
- Include issue tracker links
- Add contributor agreement if specified

**Skip if**: Closed-source project (can create simple internal version if needed)

#### SECURITY.md

**Generate if**: User wants public security reporting (Question 21)

- Process `docs/SECURITY.template.md`
- Fill security contact email
- Include bug bounty program details if applicable
- Add expected response time

**Skip if**: No public security process needed

---

### 2.7 Initialize Git Repository

**If user chose** to initialize Git (Question 26):

1. **Initialize Git repository**:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit from VibeCoding template"
   ```

2. **If remote repository specified**:
   - Verify SSH/HTTPS URL format
   - **Recommend SSH** if user provided HTTPS:

     ```
     ⚠️ Note: SSH is recommended for better security and convenience:
     - HTTPS: https://github.com/username/repo.git
     - SSH: git@github.com:username/repo.git

     Would you like to use SSH instead?
     ```
3. **Add remote and push**:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin [repository-url]
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Create .gitignore** if not exists:
   - Ensure `.ai/` is in .gitignore
   - Add language/framework-specific ignores

---

## Step 3: Customize Documentation

### Required Documentation Files

Based on project type, ensure these files are populated:

- ✅ `README.md` - Project overview (from template)
- ✅ `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture details
- ✅ `docs/TECH_STACK.md` - Technology choices and rationale
- ✅ `docs/INSTALLATION.md` - Setup instructions
- ✅ `docs/GUIDELINE.md` - Development guidelines (keep as-is)
- ✅ `LICENSE` - License file (generated based on user choice)

### Conditional Documentation Files

Generate based on user responses:

- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guide (if open-source project)
- `docs/SECURITY.md` - Security practices and reporting (if public security process)

### Optional Documentation Files

Include if relevant to the project:

- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - Development roadmap (from template)
- `docs/BUSINESS.md` - Business model (if commercial)
- `docs/RISKS.md` - Risk analysis
- `docs/MIGRATION.md` - Migration guide (if replacing existing solution)

---

## Step 4: Finalize

1. **Review generated files** for consistency
2. **Update cross-references** between documents
3. **Verify Git setup** (if initialized):
   - Confirm remote repository connection
   - Ensure SSH keys are configured (if using SSH)
   - Verify initial commit was successful
4. **Confirm with user** that all information is correct
5. **Provide next steps**:
   - Set up development environment (see `docs/INSTALLATION.md`)
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure CI/CD pipeline (if requested)
   - Set up deployment infrastructure (if specified)
   - Start development following `docs/GUIDELINE.md`

## Notes for AI

- **Be thorough**: Ask all necessary questions before generating files
- **Be adaptive**: Adjust questions based on project type
- **Be helpful**: Suggest best practices for chosen tech stack
- **Be clear**: Explain why certain information is needed
- **Don't assume**: If unclear, ask for clarification
- **Batch questions**: Group related questions together to minimize back-and-forth

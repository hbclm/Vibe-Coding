- ✅ **Team collaboration ready** - Contributing guidelines, code standards, and security practices

## 🎯 Who is this for?

### AI Assistants 🤖

- Follow structured initialization process
- Ask systematic questions
- Generate consistent project documentation
- Create appropriate directory structures

### Development Teams 👥

- Start new projects faster
- Maintain consistent documentation standards
- Follow established best practices
- Onboard new team members easily

### Solo Developers 👨‍💻

- Professional project structure from day one
- Comprehensive documentation templates
- Industry-standard guidelines
- Future-proof organization

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Use This Template

Clone or copy this repository to start a new project.

### Step 2: Initialize with AI

Ask your AI assistant to:

1. Read [`PROJECT_INIT.md`](./PROJECT_INIT.md)
2. Ask you the initialization questions
3. Generate your project documentation

### Step 3: Start Development

Follow the generated documentation and guidelines in `docs/GUIDELINE.md`.

## 📂 What's Included?

### Template Files (`.template.md`)

These files contain placeholders that AI will fill during initialization:

- `README.template.md` - Project overview
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.template.md` - System architecture
- `docs/TECH_STACK.template.md` - Technology stack details
- `docs/ROADMAP.template.md` - Development roadmap
- `docs/INSTALLATION.template.md` - Setup instructions
- `docs/BUSINESS.template.md` - Business model (optional)
- `docs/RISKS.template.md` - Risk analysis (optional)
- `docs/MIGRATION.template.md` - Migration guide (optional)

### Generic Guidelines (Keep as-is)

These files don't need modification:

- `docs/GUIDELINE.md` - Development principles and best practices
- `LICENSE` - License file

### Conditional Files (Generated based on project type)

- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guide (for open-source projects)
- `docs/SECURITY.md` - Security practices (if public security reporting)

### Initialization Files

- `PROJECT_INIT.md` - Instructions for AI to initialize projects
- `.ai/` - AI context directory (created during initialization)

## 🔄 How It Works

### For Developers

1. **Copy this template** to start your new project
2. **Ask AI**: "Please initialize a new project using VibeCoding template"
3. **Answer questions** about your project (name, tech stack, type, etc.)
4. **Review** generated documentation files
5. **Start developing** with complete project setup

### For AI Assistants

When a user requests project initialization:

1. **FIRST**: Ask about project idea and analyze (Step 0)
   - Get project concept and initial features
   - Suggest additional features
   - Wait for user confirmation
2. **Read** [`PROJECT_INIT.md`](./PROJECT_INIT.md) for complete instructions
3. **Ask** user all 26 questions systematically
4. **Process** each `.template.md` file:
   - Replace `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` with user's answers
   - Save as final `.md` file
   - Delete `.template.md` file
5. **Generate** LICENSE file based on user's choice
6. **Generate** `.ai/TODO.md` with project-specific task breakdown
7. **Conditionally create** CONTRIBUTING.md and SECURITY.md
8. **Create** `.ai/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` with project details
9. **Update** `.gitignore` to exclude `.ai/` directory
10. **Create** directory structure for chosen tech stack

### Post-Initialization Cleanup

Files to delete after initialization:

- `PROJECT_INIT.md` (instructions no longer needed)
- All `.template.md` files (already processed)

## 📖 Documentation

- **[PROJECT_INIT.md](./PROJECT_INIT.md)** - Complete initialization guide for AI
- **[docs/GUIDELINE.md](./docs/GUIDELINE.md)** - Development guidelines and best practices

## 💡 Example Use Case

**Before VibeCoding:**

- Spend hours setting up project structure
- Inconsistent documentation across projects
- Forget important files (SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md)
- No standardized guidelines

**With VibeCoding:**

- AI asks systematic questions
- Complete documentation generated in minutes
- Professional structure from day one
- Team collaboration standards included

## 🤝 How It Works

1. **AI reads** `PROJECT_INIT.md`
2. **AI asks** structured questions about your project
3. **AI processes** `.template.md` files
4. **AI replaces** `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` with your answers
5. **AI creates** final documentation files
6. **You start** developing with complete project setup
